# Wake-Vision
Wake Vision is a computer vision-based drowsiness detection system developed for vehicles to identify signs of driver sleepiness. It continuously tracks the driver's facial features and activates an audio alert when drowsiness is detected, helping to prevent accidents caused by lack of attention and promoting safer driving.
